# nightwatch-cucumber-training

Project created for testing the pages of the Hackaton of applitools just for training the Nightwatch-js with Cucumber-js.

For installing the dependencies, after cloning:
```
npm install
```

For running on Windows:
```
set ENV=APPOK & npm test = RUN OK ON WINDOWS
set ENV=APPNOK & npm test = RUN NOK ON WINDOWS
```

For running on Linux:
```
export ENV=APPOK && npm test = RUN OK ON LINUX
export ENV=APPNOK && npm test = RUN NOK ON LINUX
```

PS: This project was not created for participating of the Hackaton, since for participating we should use pure language bindings with Selenium and also use the Applitools Visualtesting API.
This project was only created for training CucumberJS with NightwatchJS, the Hackaton pages were only used for training purposes.
